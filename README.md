📦 Inventory Performance Dashboard – Power BI Project

A professional, end-to-end Power BI analytics project analysing warehouse inventory performance, including stock levels, risk classification, warehouse efficiency, holding cost, and operational KPIs.
This project demonstrates data modelling, DAX, dashboard design, and business intelligence storytelling — built exactly like a real job scenario.

<br />🚀 Project Overview
This dashboard enables warehouse and supply-chain leaders to:  
* Monitor real-time inventory value  
* Identify stock at risk before stockouts occur  
* Assess warehouse efficiency & performance  
* Analyse product-level details such as demand, forecast accuracy, reorder thresholds, and replenishment behaviour  
* Support data-driven decision making for procurement and stocking  
* The dataset used is the Logistics Warehouse Dataset sourced from Kaggle.    
  
<br />🧠 Key Business Questions Answered

✔ What is the total value of the current inventory?  
✔ How many days of stock do we have on average?  
✔ What is the total monthly holding cost?  
✔ What percentage of items are at stockout risk?  
✔ How is inventory risk distributed across products?  
✔ What is the overall Warehouse Performance Score?
